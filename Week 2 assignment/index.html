      <h1> This is a section</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>I have no idea how this works</h2>
        <p>
          I mean, I kindof do, but I still don't.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>I hope I still get full points for trying though!</h2>

          I mean, I'm OK with getting a "B-" for this assignment but I don't want a low grade either.

          If I couldn't pick section for this assignment, I would've picked Footer instead.
