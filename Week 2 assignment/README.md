NOTES AND OTHER THINGS FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.
OK so, I guess this is like a diary where I'll just write down all my thoughts since I have once again, failed to manage my time well because now I'm scrambling to get this done.
Kind of wish assignments were due at midnight for those of us who have other personal reasons that get in the way, but it's still partially my fault for not managing mytime well.
ANYWAYS!

Created assignment skeleton, with basic HTML template from first assignment.
Pasted notes from first assignment and commented them out for reference purposes only.
Will need to replace figure image examples with my own images.

Notes for tomorrow: 
-Copy letter for letter needed elements. Refer to readings.
-Read about Flexbox and Grid and decide how you want to impliment them.
-Will need to comment out code and hope that it'll be enough for now. Will work on it after turning it in though to try and make code that ACTUALLY WORKS.
-I have no idea how to change the colors of this file, I am so sorry for the eyestrain.
