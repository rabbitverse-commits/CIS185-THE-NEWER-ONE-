function countLeaves(days) {
    // Each day, leaves fall following this pattern:
    // Day 1: 10 leaves
    // Day 2: 20 leaves (doubles)
    // Day 3: 30 leaves (+10 from day 2)
    // Day 4: 40 leaves (+10 from day 3)
    // Pattern: First day doubles, then +10 each day
    
    let total = 0;
    // Use a for loop to calculate total
    
    return total;
}

function categorizeLeafColors(leaves) {
    // leaves is an array of color strings
    // Count each color and return an object
    
    let colorCount = {};
    // Loop through array and count colors
    
    return colorCount;
}

/*Might use loop here

TEACHER NOTES: 
Problem 2, for countLeaves, the total being return is a string which shows what numbers were calculated. 
I recommend using a string interpolation/template*/
