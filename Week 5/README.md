NEVER MIND IT'S A MID-TERM!

OK SO! 
I've got two ideas for the mid-term:
1) One is a cute personality quiz based on some of my favorite aesthetics.
 or
2) I make a massive hub of Pokemon birthday quizzes that calculate what kind of pokemon shares your birthday.
    I might put down how each method works but the person might as well calculate it themselves. 
    Still, it might also be cool if the person could see how each method works so that way they know why they get different pokemon from different methods. 
Or
3) A combination of both ideas, where it's like a partonus quiz, but with pokemon. Or maybe a pokemon team that's based on what aesthetic you get.
Or maybe both, and they can pick between the two different acitivities they wanna do.

To put this into perspective, a quiz based on my favorite aesthetics would fall onto the more visually appealing side of things, as I would plan on making the site change based on what aesthetic you would get. Result = website changes visually.

For the pokemon birthday methods, I would need to find a database of pokemon to pull from, while also typing down EVERY. SINGLE. METHOD. My hands hurt already from the thought of it.

Both require a lot of code but one (the quiz) has more coding in the visual department and the other (the birthday method) would have a lot of coding in the html department.

The pokemon quiz would look a bit blank so I would need SOME visuals to make it look nice but I have no idea how I would go about this.
Do I make it a drop-down menu? Radio buttons?? A grid with each method for the radio buttons? With how many methods I have already written down, I feel like it would be a bit confusing or frustrating to navigate. 

The  aesthetic quiz, however, might be hard to create because of how much will need to be coded for each option...

At this point I'm just word-vomiting out how I want this to work despite struggling to code on my own.

OK, let's sort these thoughts out:
Aesthetic Quiz: Changes website visually based on result. Lots of coding ni terms of choices and visuals. Very bare bones with nothing else going on. Can work well no matter the device.
Favorite Aesthetics include:
1-Fairygrunge
2-Cottagecore
3-Mermaid
4-Dreamcore
5-Vampire
6-Victorian
7-Goblincore
8-Witchcore
9-Angelcore
10-Eldritch Horror??
11-Lighthouse???
12-Therian?????
13-Ren Faire???
14-UNICORN???
15-Vaporwave
16-Pirate
17-Bloomcore
18-CottageGoth
19-Fairycore
20-SeaPunk
21-Secret
OK, just looked at the aesthetic wiki and it's a LOT. So I'm gonna have to narrow down the list a LOT if I wanna do this quiz idea. AND I have to find proper APPROPRIATE images to use for the results. So a lot of my time will be just creating images to use for this idea. Maybe a maximumof results will be around 15-ish results. Maybe 20 if I'm REALLY feeling it. I would also need to link the page from the "Official Wiki" at the end of every result if people wanted to look into it some more.

Pokemon Birthday Methods: 9 different methods, possibly more. I'll need to have written them down. Only the ones with steps to follow will be used for this. Visually bare. Grid of methods on desktop, every other device??? Will type out how each method works. Drop down for mobile/tablets??  Will need Pokemon database of EVERY POKEMON EVER. Lots of coding for the calculations. Visually? Bare bones. (Tried looking up Pokemon aesthetics and got something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT).
