DOM TECHNIQUES AND HOW I USED THEM! 
(Plus little diary entries about my train of thought)

October 28th, 2025:
Just started the homework assignment at 11-ish in the morning, got all the files needed put together first. Now I just gotta code.

I have no idea what exactly we need to do, as the assignment at the the end of week 5's thursdays slides just tells us what to create.

I know it's a form, with validation and data submission with DOM techniques but I still feel lost on what exacly we're doing. The example from Thursdays slides look like what we need to do, so I might copy it with my own flair, but I'm not sure.

Hopefully, it'll be another work day for class. Otherwise, I'll have to ask for help after class.
