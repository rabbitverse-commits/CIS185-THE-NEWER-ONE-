NEVER MIND IT'S A MID-TERM!

Nov 4th, 2025
OK SO! 
I've got two ideas for the mid-term:
1) One is a cute personality quiz based on some of my favorite aesthetics.
 or
2) I make a massive hub of Pokemon birthday quizzes that calculate what kind of pokemon shares your birthday.
    I might put down how each method works but the person might as well calculate it themselves. 
    Still, it might also be cool if the person could see how each method works so that way they know why they get different pokemon from different methods. 
Or
3) A combination of both ideas, where it's like a partonus quiz, but with pokemon. Or maybe a pokemon team that's based on what aesthetic you get.
Or maybe both, and they can pick between the two different acitivities they wanna do.

To put this into perspective, a quiz based on my favorite aesthetics would fall onto the more visually appealing side of things, as I would plan on making the site change based on what aesthetic you would get. Result = website changes visually.

For the pokemon birthday methods, I would need to find a database of pokemon to pull from, while also typing down EVERY. SINGLE. METHOD. My hands hurt already from the thought of it.

Both require a lot of code but one (the quiz) has more coding in the visual department and the other (the birthday method) would have a lot of coding in the html department.

The pokemon quiz would look a bit blank so I would need SOME visuals to make it look nice but I have no idea how I would go about this.
Do I make it a drop-down menu? Radio buttons?? A grid with each method for the radio buttons? With how many methods I have already written down, I feel like it would be a bit confusing or frustrating to navigate. 

The  aesthetic quiz, however, might be hard to create because of how much will need to be coded for each option...

At this point I'm just word-vomiting out how I want this to work despite struggling to code on my own.

OK, let's sort these thoughts out:
Aesthetic Quiz: Changes website visually based on result. Lots of coding ni terms of choices and visuals. Very bare bones with nothing else going on. Can work well no matter the device.
Favorite Aesthetics include:
1-Fairygrunge
2-Cottagecore
3-Mermaid
4-Dreamcore
5-Vampire
6-Victorian
7-Goblincore
8-Witchcore
9-Angelcore
10-Eldritch Horror??
11-Lighthouse???
12-Therian?????
13-Ren Faire???
14-UNICORN???
15-Vaporwave
16-Pirate
17-Bloomcore
18-CottageGoth
19-Fairycore
20-SeaPunk
21-Secret
OK, just looked at the aesthetic wiki and it's a LOT. So I'm gonna have to narrow down the list a LOT if I wanna do this quiz idea. AND I have to find proper APPROPRIATE images to use for the results. So a lot of my time will be just creating images to use for this idea. Maybe a maximum of results will be around 15-ish results. Maybe 20 if I'm REALLY feeling it. I would also need to link the page from the "Official Wiki" at the end of every result if people wanted to look into it some more.

Pokemon Birthday Methods: 9 different methods, possibly more. I'll need to have written them down. Only the ones with steps to follow will be used for this. Visually bare. Grid of methods on desktop, every other device??? Will type out how each method works. Drop down for mobile/tablets??  Will need Pokemon database of EVERY POKEMON EVER. Lots of coding for the calculations. Visually? Bare bones.

OK SO! I have decided to ALSO do a game like some of my other classmates. Here is why.
The quiz would be a bit lackluster in just being a simple quiz. However, I had a weird dream last night that got me thinking about all the other games I wanted to make in the long run. That in turn, got me thinking abot my mid-term and the aesthetics quiz spoke out to me more than anything. Combine that with wanting to make a game and the next thing I know, I wanted to make a text-based adventure (with lots of reading) quiz thing based off of a story I have in mind where EVERYTHING is aesthetices personified. 

Bascially, Pokemon is getting scrapped because of how complicated some of the birtdhay methods are, and I now want to make a game based off of one of my stories. So it's a text-based novel adventure game where your actions give you the aesthetic (and possibly character??!) you best resemeble. 

You'll be put in odd scenarios depicting different side characters in the world (and possibly the main characters), and how you react to certain situations will give you your asethetic. In a way, it's still a fun personailty quiz, but with a twist. I might even add a comment box for suggestions, I don't know yet. And in terms of what the characters look like, for the sake of time, I'm gonna use Doll Maker Websites to showcase what I have in mind. That is also something I'm not sure about yet either, the characters picture showing up. 
For now, I wanna make sure the adventure works and nothing breaks (after I start on it). But I am definitely using this chance to get feedback on a world I want to create for the future, so what better way to do that than to use it as a target for my mid-term project?

Welp, guess I'm doing the "Do-It-All-At-The-Last-Minute" work flow tactic since I haven't given myself enough time to work on the project itself (though to be fair, I had DND on Sunday). So my goal is to get as much as I can get done for the next three days and turn in what I have, no matter how unpolished it is. Luckily, (and fingers crossed I don't jinx myself. Knock on wood.) once I have it all drawn out and figured out visually what I want, the rest of the project should be easy-peezy. I might even go as far as to include the character portraits and what not. I wish I gave myself more time to draw out these characters, but it's fine. Even the story itself isn't as fully polished as the website is gonna be.

 # Project Name: Randomly Genereated AI: A Totally Normal Life// A text-based adventure game
          ## CIS 185 - Midterm Project
          ## Author: Marian Bambaloff

          ## 1. Project Description
          What is your website about? (2-3 sentences) 
          OK, so looking back on it now, I basically made a text-based adventure where your choices matter, but the result is what aesthetic you are, instead of what ending you got. But at the same time, I guess it's the same as a personality quiz, but with a fancier feel to it, since it's a text-based adventure and not an actual quiz. But it's also a quiz if you think about how your input matters on what result you get, which is similar to what a text-based adventure is... My head slightly hurts now, but it's a text-based adventure aesthetic personality quiz, for a lack of a better title. You read situation, pick an option, and continue until you get your result. accompanied with the character corresponding to it, and a link to the aesthetic itself on the "official" aesthetic wiki. For more information, I would look at the diagram I will somehow figure out how to attach to this project. But yeah, fancy personality quiz with a story attached and characters form said story. Plus a secret result you can get... Somehow.

          ## 2. Target Audience
          Who will use your website? Why? 
          Honestly, only people who want to take a fun personality quiz, or want to read some snippets of my story would use my site. Or people similar to that. I don't really know who will use it, honestly. I'm just using it as a way to flesh out the concepts of a story idea I have.

          ## 3. Main Features (I don't really understand what this question is asking.)
          - Feature 1: Multiple choice options
          - Feature 2: The questions
          - Feature 3: Photos of each aesthetic
          - Feature 4: Responsive designs for most devices

          ## 4. Technologies Used
          - HTML (For the base coding and words and buttons.) 
          - CSS (For looking pretty.) 
          - JavaScript (For the more 'complex' coding for both the CSS and HTML file.) 
          - I guess GoogleAI, depsite there being a section about AI usage.

          ## 5. File Structure (Also don't understand what this question is asking.)
          Explain your organization:
          - index.html  

          - css/style.css 
          - Main stylesheet
          
          - js/script.js
          - JavaScript functionality

          ## 6. Challenges Faced
          What was difficult? How did you solve it? 
          My coding and time management were abysmal this time around and I realized too late just how much work I was putting into this assignment. So, at the last minute, I had to use AI to help with the coding part since I struggle to code on my own. My plan was to look at the code AI made, and make comments on what does what to better understand and reference for future coding attempts. I really should've gave myself more time to do this but I was too focused on my other assignments to notice what day it was. Plus, with how busy I was on the day the assignment is due, I am be surprised I'm managing to get it turned in before 11:50 PM.

          ## 7. AI Tools Used
          List any AI tools and how you used them: 
          - GoogleAI from here on out: I used GoogleAI to help with the structure of all my code throughout all my files, as well as help me figure out WHAT code I needed to use for the files. So bascially, I had it create templates for me to use and work backwards on in order to understand more about what I'm coding exactly. I filled in the blanks and changed a few things but I (or I tried to) comment on different lines of code to show my understanding.
           
          ## 8. Future Improvements
          What would you add with more time? 
          - Character pictures.
          - Result images.
          - More descriptions of questions, choices and results.
          - A more polished look overall.

          ## 9. Credits
          - Images from pinterest and google
          - AI assistance as noted in Section 7
        (Images for characters would be from Picrew, Doll Divine, or some other dress up game).
        (Moodboards for aesthetics will be done by me).
        (Basic background images will be found by Google, No AI).
        (And of course, links to wikis of the aesthetic will be included).
