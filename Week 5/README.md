NEVER MIND IT'S A MID-TERM!

OK SO! 
I've got two ideas for the mid-term:
1) One is a cute personality quiz based on some of my favorite aesthetics.
 or
2) I make a massive hub of Pokemon birthday quizzes that calculate what kind of pokemon shares your birthday.
    I might put down how each method works but the person might as well calculate it themselves. 
    Still, it might also be cool if the person could see how each method works so that way they know why they get different pokemon from different methods.

Or
3) A combination of both ideas, where it's like a partonus quiz, but with pokemon. Or maybe a pokemon team that's based on what aesthetic you get.
