MOD TECHNIQUES AND HOW I USED THEM

October 28th, 2025:
Just started the homework assignment at 11-ish in the morning, got all the files needed put together first. Now I just gotta code.

I have no idea what exactly we need to do, as the assignment at the the end of week 5's thursdays slides just tells us what to create.

I know it's a form, with validation and data submission with DOM techniques but I still feel lost on what exacly we're doing. The example from Thursdays slides look like what we need to do, so I might copy it with my own flair, but I'm not sure.

Hopefully, it'll be another work day for class. Otherwise, I'll have to ask for help after class.

Took some examples from Week 5's slides to set up what I believe the code should look like. I still don't know what's expected of me in terms of DOM techniques, but I think I understand the assignment SOMEWHAT. 

I'll see if I can do the CSS on my own so I get that part of coding down better. Hopefully, it's formatted right too, that's another thing I'm not sure on.

Just found out that I can check the outline if a certain line of code doesn't look like it's working, and to understand it better as well. This is getting interesting.
