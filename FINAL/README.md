THIS IS THE FINAL!!

I choose to recreate the game from scratch, following the video as best as I could.

Stopped at 13:18, on December 7th, 2025 at 5:30.

Started watching it again at around 1:50 something (I should've written down times I started. Oh well).

Finished video at 4:30 PM on December 8th, 2025. 

Feature I added: Health Bar. I didn't want to rely on the videos maed by the same person for a health system so I turned to AI to help with that. I also used AI to help detect any mispellings I had in my code. 

I knew it had to be something similar to the progress bars we first learned in the first two weeks of class, but I didn't know how to implement it so that it would work. 

(<progress value="75" max="100">75% Complete</progress>/<meter value="8" min="0" max="10">8 out of 10</meter>)

I am VERY THANKFUL for github. I ain't getting rid of my account ANY TIME SOON.
