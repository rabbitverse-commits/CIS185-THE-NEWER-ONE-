# CIS185-THE-NEWER-ONE-
# HTML Elements Exploration Assignment

**Student Name:** Marian Bambaloff  
**Course:** CIS 185
**Assignment One:** HTML Elements Challenge  
**Date:** October 1-2, 2025

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of various HTML elements beyond the basic ones covered in class. I've created an extended web page that showcases different HTML elements and their functionality, along with custom CSS styling. I tried to get the coding to work but I don't really know how to do that yet...

## HTML Elements Implemented

### 1. `<button>` (Styled)
**Purpose:** Creates clickable buttons for user interaction  
**How I used it:** Added interactive buttons with hover effects that people could click for fun. I have no idea what they're for yet...
**Why it's useful:** Provides clear call-to-action elements that are accessible and customizable. But also, pressing buttons are fun.

Example below:
```html
<button type="button">Click Me!</button>
```
My version:
<type="button">DON'T PRESS</button>

### 2. `<details>` (Styled)
**Purpose:** Creates collapsible content sections.
**How I used it:** Created an expandable section where users can click to reveal what kind of plans I have for this site. I made it fancy too! (Or tired too)
**Why it's useful:** Saves space on the page while organizing content in a fun, interactive way! :D I also made it pretty, or as pretty as I can make it for now...

Example below:
```html
<details>
    <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language...</p>
</details>
```
My version:
<type= details></type>

### 3. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
**Purpose:** Adds a visual to the words nearby, or perhaps to break up large blocks of text.  
**How I used it:** Images!!! Added a fun image with a descriptive caption below it. 
**Why it's useful:** Provides a description of the selected image for accessibility.

Example below:
```html
<figure>
    <img src="web-development.jpg" alt="Person coding">
    <figcaption>A developer working on a web application</figcaption>
</figure>
```
My version:
N/A Will need to workshop it some more

### 3. `<meter/progress>`
**Purpose:** Displays the completion progress of a task  
**How I used it:** I used it as a way to showcase the progress of how mush farther until this site is completed.
**Why it's useful:** Visually represents completion or loading states without JavaScript.

Example below:
```html
<progress value="75" max="100">75% Complete</progress>
```

```html
<meter value="8" min="0" max="10">8 out of 10</meter>
```
My version:
<meter id="Completion??" min="0" max="100" low="33" high="66" optimum="80" value="50"></meter>
  at 10/100
  </meter>
<label for="file">File progress:</label>
<progress id="file" max="100" value="70">10%</progress>

### 4. `<section/footer>` (Styled)
**Purpose:** To provide additional information for the user.
**How I used it:** I used it much similiar to the details element, where I put additional info about the site and what I want to do with it.
**Why it's useful:** It's useful for additional information users want to read.
My version:
<html><section><html>

## CSS Styling Applied

I already wrote (Styled) next to the elements I tried to style but somehow, I couldn't figure out how to make it show on the site itself. I'm still gonna put those elements labled (Styled) here because that's how the example was formatted.

- **`<details>`**: Wanted to add a pretty border and some cute background colors
- **`<section/footer>`**: Wanted to make the section/footer pretty, give it a border that was nice to look at and differentiate the section/footer from the rest of the web.
- **`<button>`**: Wanted to create a hover effect that changed the way the button looked, as well as see if it was possible for it emit sparkles when clicked.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I learned:

1. **How to code properly** - While copying and pasting can seem easier to do, I decided to just type out everything from my notepad to get a feel of how typing everything out works.
2. **Planning things might be better** -Perhaps if I had planned out what I wanted to do in terms of this assignment better, I wouldn't be struggling now to get it done and on time. But in a later section, you'll see that I struggled with managing my time better because of how swamped I became. So I learned that perhaps giving myself an hour at least would help me stay ahead (slightly).
3. **Relying on the readings** -W3 schools is great for helping me be reminded on what does what, and I think I learned that relying on it from time to time could help further my understanding on the code. The HTML reference website would also help in showing me the basic structure on how that code is made. I can also look to the slides for help as well.
4. **In terms of coding... How to Comment out stuff!** -Because of my poor time managment skills, I had to rush this to get it done so some of the code may not work, or I don't have anything properly set up for the code to work with. So, I learned how to comment out code in case I have a repeat of today and need to turn something in at the last minute (Sadly). For some reason, I can't comment out with the slashes.
5. **Styling!! ...Kind of** -After some fiddling with the code I have now, I found out that <Style> has its tag! (Or class, I forget what it's classified as). However, some of it wasn't working so I had to comment it out.

## Challenges Encountered

- **GETTING THINGS TO WORK**: I have no idea how to properly display the stylized code without showing the code. 
- **MY TIME MANAGMENT SKILLS**: Honestly, due to outside forces (aka, my part-time job and other 2 classes), I have failed to give myself time to work on this homework assignment, as well as other assignments. 
- **Just understanding what's happening**: I struggled a lot with my previous coding class because of how fast everything felt. Despite being a beginner class, it felt like I had jumped straight into coding instead of learning the basics slowly and understanding the UIs and what everything means in terms of coding. Like breaking down words to fully understand them better.

## Resources Used
