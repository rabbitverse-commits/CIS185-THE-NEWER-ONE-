    <h1>Welcome to My Website! (or as much of a website it is now...)</h1>
    <p class="highlight">This paragraph is highlighted.</p>
    <p id="special-paragraph">This paragraph is special.</p>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
    <p>I'm learning web development!(AND I'M PANICKING!!!!!!! THIS CLASS IS GOING SO FAST AND I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENING!!!! AAAAAAAAAAA!!!!)</p>
    <p>There'll be more someday! I promise!</p>

<h1>Main section that may or may not work</h1>
<main>
  <h1>A title would go here</h1>
  <p>Sadly, I don't have a major idea of where anything goes.</p>

  <article>
    <h2>Another title goes here</h2>
    <p>Maybe I can get help with like... the structure of this mess of code and help me write some notes....</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>I need tutor help... probably</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I think that's best. I'm actually excited for when this all comes together well and it actually LOOKS GOOD.</p>

    <h1>Intro and about HERE!</h1>
    <p>Chances are, running this will show the code or crash.</p>
    <p>So if that's the case, at least the teacher can see my code.</p>

    <h2>ANYWAYS! HERE I AM!</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Marian Bambaloff!</p>
    <p>I am a student at SPSCC!</p>
    <p>I am currently trying to code but writing the code is harder than learning about it. Go figure.</p>
    <p>I would have more here, but I'm still tring to understand and memorize code!</p>
    <p>So... there won't be any projects or project sections or any other required parts since I have no idea what I'm doing half the time.</p>

      <h1> This is a section</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>I have no idea how this works</h2>
        <p>
          I mean, I kindof do, but I still don't.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>I hope I still get full points for trying though!</h2>
        <p>
          I mean, I'm OK with getting a "B-" for this assignment but I don't want a low grade either.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I couldn't pick section for this assignment, I would've picked Footer instead.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Is nav and main a different type of class?</h3>
        <p>Because I have no idea if it is.</p>
        <p>I need to do some more reading if I wanna know what it is I'm doing in this class.</p>

<h1>THIS IS A FLEXBOX CONTAINER</h1>

<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1 WIP</div>
  <div>Item 2 WIP</div>
  <div>Item 3 WIP</div>
</div>
<p>I have no idea if this works.</p>
<p>If it doesn't, then I'll just comment it out(WELL OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T CRASH MY PROGRAM SO IT WORKS SOMEWHAT)</p>

</body>


<h1>THIS IS A GRID</h1>
<p>This probably doesn't work well since this is just in the styles file and not the actual html</p>
<p>Additional comment: I'll put the non-style stuff in the html file as a comment but without proper placement since I have no idea where some of this stuff goes.</p>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
