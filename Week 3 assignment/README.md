This README is for the compare and contrast of both Manual and Bootstrap coding. 
Below is the assignment itself, some feedback I got from my first assignment, and the coding from the slides needed to complete this assignment.
I have sorted the coding as BOOTSTRAP and MANUAL on Notepad so I know which piece of code came from what slide and reference that slide accordingly depending on what I'm coding.

The comparisons!

Manual vs Bootstrap Implementation

ðŸ“‹ Your Mission: Create TWO Versions of Your Portfolio

    Version 1: Manual Responsive Design
    Take your Assignment 1 portfolio and manually add responsive features using:
        Media queries (@media) 
        [So far, things con't look like they'll break, so I think I'm doing great. I think I'm done. Hopefully it works.]

        Flexible images (max-width) 
        [Done with the code from the slides. Possibly in the wrong spot but I'm not sure.]

        Viewport units (vw, vh) 
        [Done? Hopefully. Plus, it won't work well in the css flie for some reason]

        CSS Grid or Flexbox 
        [Did I need to change the code that's already there? Probably, but not for now. I'll like.... get a tutor or something for that.]

    Version 2: Bootstrap Responsive Design
    Create a second version using Bootstrap 5 to handle responsiveness:
        Bootstrap grid system
        Bootstrap components
        Bootstrap utilities
    ReadMe.md: Compare & Contrast
    Write a detailed comparison of both approaches
