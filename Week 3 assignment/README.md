This README is for the compare and contrast of both Manual and Bootstrap coding. 
Below is the assignment itself, some feedback I got from my first assignment, and the coding from the slides needed to complete this assignment.
I have sorted the coding as BOOTSTRAP and MANUAL on Notepad so I know which piece of code came from what slide and reference that slide accordingly depending on what I'm coding.

-----------------------------
The comparisons!

First off, since adding the code needed for this assignment, I can't run my code, which is weird. There are no errors, so I think it might be a
coding placement issue instead of an actual coding issue. So I can only compare the way the code is formatted between Manual and Bootstrap. Not to mention,
I have no idea where goes where in terms of the responsive code, so that migh also contribute to my program not running.

Manual: OK, so it's a lot of code you have to type. And it bounces between the CSS file and the HTML file, which means a bit of a back-and-forth between files that can be seen
as tedious. But watching all the text change colors because its in the right file is statisfying so I'll give it that. You also have to manually type out the sizes for Manual,
(though that could also be the same case for Boostrap, I'm not sure), which can be frustrating if you're not sure how big certain devices are (especiall since technology is changing sizes all the time). It seems a majority of the Manual sizing is in the CSS file (that I may have forgotten we learned in class) but it makes sense since we're not adding anything new to the html file, just sizing options that change the way the website looks on different devices. When compared to Bootstrap, it looks like more going back and forth between files and more code to ensure the sizes look right but other than that, it seems best for those who like to write a lot of code.

Bootstrap: It feels like there is even more code to type out for Bootstrap, but at the same time, I have no idea where to put said Bootstrap code so it could very well be like the Maunal responsive code where its back and forth between the CSS file and the HTML file. A differnece between the two different responsive codes is that you put this one line of Bootstrap code near the top of your entire code before working on the rest. Then, you can pull from different Bootstrap classes without having to think much. I mean, you do the same for the Viewpoint line of code when Manually putting in the responsive code, but this feels like with the Bootstrap starter line, you don't have to do much afterwards. So all in all for Bootstrap, it feels like less coding while also having just as much to code as Manual.

Because my code won't work, I couldn't properly test out the different codes and properly do this comparison. Looking back, I think Bootstrap nearly has just as much to code in terms of responsiveness compared to Manual, but a lot of my comparisons still borders on how it was like to type out the code and trying to figure out where it went. I have no idea why my code doesn't want to work now, but I'm slowly understanding my previous assignments with every feedback and new slide I see. This is the best I can do, and I really should schedule that tutoring session. 

All in all, I did my best, and I think I prefer like Maunal for its repetitive coding that looks familiar to past code I did, but Bootstrap is good for not wanting to write a bunch of code.

Assignment 3 notes below!
Manual vs Bootstrap Implementation
Due: Next Thursday
ðŸ“‹ Your Mission: Create TWO Versions of Your Portfolio

    Version 1: Manual Responsive Design
    Take your Assignment 1 portfolio and manually add responsive features using:
        Media queries (@media) 
        [So far, things con't look like they'll break, so I think I'm doing great. I think I'm done. Hopefully it works.]

        Flexible images (max-width) 
        [Done with the code from the slides. Possibly in the wrong spot but I'm not sure.]

        Viewport units (vw, vh) 
        [Done? Hopefully. Plus, it won't work well in the css flie for some reason]

        CSS Grid or Flexbox 
        [Did I need to change the code that's already there? Probably, but not for now. I'll like.... get a tutor or something for that.]

    Version 2: Bootstrap Responsive Design
    Create a second version using Bootstrap 5 to handle responsiveness:
        Bootstrap grid system
        Bootstrap components
        Bootstrap utilities
    ReadMe.md: Compare & Contrast
    Write a detailed comparison of both approaches

ðŸ“± Required Breakpoints (Minimum 3 Sizes):

Mobile: 320px - 767px
Tablet: 768px - 1023px
Desktop: 1024px and above
----------------------------------------
Assignment 1 notes:
- DIRECTORY STRUCTURE: 4.5/5 : You html file should have a .html extension at the end.
- CONTENT QUALITY: 7/10 : a single html file should have only one html tag in the entire file (I deleted all other html tags so that way there's only one near the top of the code, and one closing /html file on the very bottom. Though I forgot to do that on the Bootstrap version so I am unsure as to why my code isn't working.)
